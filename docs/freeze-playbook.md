# üßä Lab Freeze Playbook

## What Does Freeze Do?
- **Blocks all merges** to `lab` branch via required status check
- **Freeze Gate** check fails when frozen, preventing merge button
- Works with auto-merge, manual merge, and CLI merges
- **State stored on `freeze-state` branch** (no protected branch bypass needed)

## One-Time Setup

‚úÖ **No PAT or bypass needed!** The system uses a dedicated `freeze-state` branch that isn't protected.

### Verify Setup
1. Check that `freeze-state` branch exists
2. Confirm `.ops/lab-freeze.json` exists on that branch
3. Ensure "Freeze Gate" is in required status checks for `lab`

## How to Use

### üî¥ Turn ON Freeze
1. Find any open PR or Issue
2. Add label: **`freeze-lab`**
3. Watch Actions tab ‚Üí "Freeze Toggle" workflow runs
4. State file updated on `freeze-state` branch
5. Check any PR targeting lab ‚Üí **Freeze Gate: ‚ùå Failing**
6. Comment posted: "üßä Freeze ENABLED (state updated on branch `freeze-state`)"

### üü¢ Turn OFF Freeze  
1. Remove label: **`freeze-lab`**
2. Workflow runs again
3. State file updated on `freeze-state` branch
4. PRs show **Freeze Gate: ‚úÖ Passing**
5. Comment posted: "üßä Freeze DISABLED (state updated on branch `freeze-state`)"

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Workflow fails to push | Ensure `freeze-state` branch exists |
| Freeze Gate not updating | Trigger PR sync or wait for next push |
| Freeze Gate not showing | Check Settings ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Required status checks includes "Freeze Gate" |
| Label doesn't trigger workflow | Ensure label is exactly `freeze-lab` (case-sensitive) |
